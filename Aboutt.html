            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Geopolitics is a framework for understanding the world and how countries, businesses, <br>
	       and terrorist groups use geographical features to achieve political goals.<br>
               It's the study of how geography affects politics and international relations.<br>
<br>
<br>
             
           Geopolitics is concerned with:
<ul>
<li>International relations</li>
<li>Geostrategic concerns of major powers</li>
<li>The interaction between geographical settings and perspectives and political processes</li>
<li>Geopolitical competition</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br> 
Geopolitics is a future-oriented concept that offers insights into the likely behavior of states.<br>
States need to secure resources, protect their territory including borderlands, and manage their populations.<br> 
Geopolitics uses geographical frames to make sense of world affairs.<br>
Popular geographical templates include "sphere of influence", "bloc", "backyard", "neighborhood", and "near abroad".

            <h2>How important is Geo-politics? </h2>
            <p> <ul> 
                <li>Geopolitics is important because it can help people understand global issues related to territory and conflict.</li>
                <li>It can also help people provide solutions to improve the situation.</li>
                <li>Geopolitics is also important for making strategic decisions. </li>
                For example,<br>
                <li>It can help people decide where to locate operations, manage political risks, and manage supply chains.<br></li>
                <li>Geopolitics is also important for investors. Geopolitical risk can have a tangible impact on investment outcomes.</li>
                <li>On a macroeconomic level, these risks can impact capital markets conditions, such as economic growth, interest rates, and market volatility.</li>
</ul>

            <h2>How it helps a Country for its Future? </h2>
            <p> Geopolitics is the study of how countries, businesses, and terrorist groups try to achieve political goals by controlling geographical features.<br>
                Geopolitics can help countries in many ways, including:
              </p>

<h3> Understanding power and influence
</h3>
<p>Geopolitics helps countries understand how geography shapes the distribution of power and influence.<br>
 This can help countries make strategic decisions about where to locate operations, manage political risks, and more.
</p>
<h3>Understanding the future</h3>
<p>Geopolitics is future-oriented and can offer insights into the likely behavior of states.<br>
 For example, geopolitical forecasts can help define how these fractions can affect future and present situations and crises.</p>
<h3>Understanding tax factors</h3>
<p>How a country establishes its tax settings is fundamental to the long-term fiscal stability of a nation.</p>
<h3>Understanding the impact of climate change</h3>
<p>For example, the opening of the Arctic will help Russia, even as it is hurt by the declining value of its natural gas.</p>
<h3>Understanding the impact of trade conflicts</h3>
<p>The outbreak of large-scale trade conflicts can have spillover effects on the future path of sectoral productivities of all countries.</p>

            <h2>How it directly affects the growth of a nation?</h2>
            <p>Geopolitics is the study of how Earth's geography affects politics and international relations.</p>
            <p>Geopolitical risks can affect a nation's growth in a number of ways, including:</p>
	    <h3>Economic development</h3>
	    <p>Geopolitical risks can hinder domestic economic development by inhibiting the inflow of foreign direct investment (FDI). <br>
               Political instability and policy uncertainty can also affect economic well-being by constraining individuals' decisions in the marketplace.</p>
            <h3>Trade</h3>
            <p>Increased restrictions due to tensions between countries can disrupt trade flows, cause supply chain problems, and affect commodity prices.</p>
 	    <h3>Investment</h3>
            <p>Investment flows into conflict-affected regions often decline, as investors seek to minimize risk.</p>
